- Automatic merge of your Project package.json with `gulp update_json` or `npm run woodoo-init`

## Getting Started with full automatic NPM Setup 
In this case the Buildtool setup will create and install all necessary files.

🤩 This might take only a few seconds 

```
npx woodoo-buildtools
```
Just follow the install instructions.


## Alternative: Installation via Composer
#### 1. Installation
Add following lines to your composer.json
```
  "extra": {
    "installer-paths":{
      "./woodoo-buildtools/core": ["dermatz/woodoo-buildtools"]
    }
  }
```

Now run these commands in your project root to install woodoo buildtools in root/woodoo-buildtools
```
composer.phar config repositories.woodoo-buildtools git https://gitlab.com/dermatz/woodoo-buildtools.git
composer.phar require dermatz/woodoo-buildtools --dev "^2.1.12"
```

#### Step 2: Woodoo Setup

Just switch into Woodoo-Buildtool folder and run the install script
```
cd woodow-buildtools
sh core/setup.sh
```

Follow the instructions in setup.
During the setup you will get new files in the woodoo-buildtools folder, if they are not exist.
After the Setup you can easily build your whole frontend project
from woodoo-buildtools folder. Just run `gulp` from the woodoo buildtool folder in your console.

#### Update Woodoo with Project NPM Packages
In this case you can run `gulp update` in the woodoo-buildtools folder.
Otherwise you can run `gulp update-json` to simply just update the project- and wooodoo json files.

#### Just a tip: Get a perfect folder structure
To get best results you can get this sample-project sturcture.
